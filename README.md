# calendar-maker
Python script to automatically create a pdf calendar to print for any year. It will display each month in one different page.

## How to use
1. Run the file in console
`python calendar-maker.py`
2. User will be asked the year. For example, this would be the console line for year 2023
`Year: 2023`
where 2023 is user input
3. The program will automatically create a file `calendar_2023.pdf` (the digits after the underscore depend on the year) with the generated calendar. If the execution is successful, the following line will show in console:
`Calendar generated: calendar_2023.pdf`
