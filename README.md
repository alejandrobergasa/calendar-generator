# calendar-maker
Python script to automatically create a pdf calendar to print for any year. It will display each month in one different page.

## How to use
1. Run the file in console. You can run it directly with the desired years as input parameters or without them.
   - Without parameters: `python calendar-maker.py 2023 2024 2025` (you can put as many as you want)
   - With parameters: `python calendar-maker.py`
2. If you didn't use parameters, you will be asked one.
3. The program will automatically create a file `calendar_xxxx.pdf` for each year (the digits after the underscore depend on the year) with the generated calendar. If the execution is successful, the following line will show in console:
`Calendar generated: calendar_2023.pdf`

4. This line means nothing.
